Developed as part of a course on Mobile Computing, this is a Windows Phone application that allows you to share old books, furniture, etc with the local community. You can give away old items that you no longer need to a neighbor who may have need of them. One man's trash is another's treasure.

A video describing the application can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Y97aNSQDQ
